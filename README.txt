		Framework for network and GUI based programs in C++ with SFML 2.0



This framework (will) contain classes for various GUI elements, some TCP and UDP multiple socket handling classes that will
allow for a fast and simple construction of networked programs, and a sprite class that allows efficient creation of 
animated sprites.

Other Extra classes will use these classes to create a few modular templates, this way, for example; a multiple client
handling server or options menu will only have to be written once.

The aim is to graduly create a small and simple modular library that will allow the user to write in c++ without having
to rewrite code that has been written before.
